## The time it took you to perform the exercise
About 5 hours

## The parts that were difficult for you and why
The turn on the platform turned out to be hacky.

## The parts you think you could do better and how
Win / loss screen and scene transitions could be there, could have added particles and 
screen shake for hammers. I also should have added an opponent. Player movement could be
satisfying jucy thing but here it's not. 

I could do with less obstacles but put more juice in the one that I've made.

## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I would add an opponent and juiced up the interactions.

## What did you think
I think it's a nice test, fun to take.
